# ADR-001: Center of Mass vs Geometric Center

## Context
Objects detected from segmentation masks have two natural reference points:
- Geometric center (bounding box midpoint)
- Center of mass (centroid of mask pixels)

## Decision
Expose both as `pose_center()` and `pose_com()` respectively in the `Object` class.

## Rationale
- **Center of Mass (CoM)** is generally better for irregular shapes. For many robotic manipulation tasks, the gripper should target the center of mass to ensure stable picks.
- **Geometric Center** is simpler and works well for regular, box-shaped objects. It is also a common fallback when a full segmentation mask is not available.
- Providing both allows users to choose the most appropriate reference point for their specific use case (e.g., visual alignment vs. physical manipulation).

## Consequences
- Slight increase in API complexity due to having two similar methods.
- Users must understand the difference between the two to use the library effectively.
- Future consideration: If usage patterns show that one is overwhelmingly preferred, we might consider deprecating the other or making one the default while keeping the other accessible.
